    <ol>
      <li>What if I want to remove an element other than the first or last from an array? There's got to be a more efficient way than popping/shifting to the relevant position and then rebuilding the array.</li>
      <li>For question 8, is there a good way to write the while loop without introducing a variable for counting?</li>
    </ol>
